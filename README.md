SOFTENG 325 Assignment 01 - A Concert Booking Service
==========

System description
----------
A booking service is required for a small venue, with a capacity of 120 seats. The venue's seats are classified into three price bands, Silver, Gold and Platinum. A concert may run on multiple dates, and each concert has at least one performer. Additionally, a performer may feature in multiple concerts.

The service is to allow clients to retrieve information about concerts and performers, to make and enquire about seats and reservations, and to authenticate users.

When making a reservation, clients may enquire about available seats. They should be informed of any unbooked seats, along with their pricing. Clients may select any number of seats to book. When making a reservation request, double-bookings are not permitted. Only one client should be allowed to book a given seat for a given concert on a given date. Clients may not make partial bookings - either *all* of a client's selected seats are booked, or *none* of them are.

Clients may view concert and performer information, and enquire about available seating, whether or not they are authenticated. When authenticated, clients gain the ability to make reservations, and to view their own reservations. Clients should never be able to view the reservation information for other guests.

In addition, clients should be able to subscribe to information regarding concert bookings. Specifically, they should be able to subscribe to "watch" one or more concerts / dates, and be notified when those concerts / dates are about to sell out.

A particular quality attribute that the service must satisfy is scalability. It is expected that the service will experience high load when concert tickets go on sale.
